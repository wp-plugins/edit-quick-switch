Easily switch between edit screens on posts, pages, and custom post types.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a searchable dropdown to post, page, and custom post type edit pages that allows you to quickly switch to edit another entry of the same content type. For example, you might be editing a Contact page and decide you you need also edit your About page. Instead of clicking over to Pages, finding the About page, and then clicking edit, you can simply search for the About page right from the Contact page, and immediately click to edit it.
